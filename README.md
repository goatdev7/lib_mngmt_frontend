# Library Management Project 

A complete Library Management System built using Django (backend) and React (frontend). This system enables efficient management of a library's books, borrowing, and reservations. It also supports user authentication and interaction through a modern user interface. 

## Setup (React) 

`cd lib_mngmt_front`
`npm install`
`npm start`

Access the application: - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 
 

## Contributing
- Fork the repository. 
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`). 
- Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`). 
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`). 
- Create a pull request. P.S: This is a sample project created to learn and practice DRF and REACT.
